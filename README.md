## What is the Repository Pattern?

The **Repository Pattern** is a design pattern used to separate the logic that interacts with the database (or any data source) from the business logic in your application. It acts as an intermediary between the data access layer and the business logic layer.

### Key Points:
- The repository provides a set of methods to query, save, and delete data.
- It allows you to **decouple** your business logic from data access logic.
- If you want to change the underlying data source (for example, from SQL Server to MongoDB), you only need to modify the repository, not the rest of your application.

### Example of a Repository Interface:
```csharp
public interface IWeatherForecastRepository
{
    // An interface is a contract that defines the signature of the functionality.
    // It defines a set of methods that a class that implements the interface must implement.
    // The interface is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
    // Interfaces are not classes, however, and cannot be instantiated.
    // Interfaces can be used in unit testing to mock out the actual implementation.
    Task<List<WeatherForecast>> GetWeatherForecastAsync();
    Task<WeatherForecast> GetWeatherForecastByIdAsync(int id);
    Task<WeatherForecast> CreateWeatherForecastAsync(WeatherForecast weatherForecast);
    Task<WeatherForecast> UpdateWeatherForecastAsync(int id, WeatherForecast weatherForecast);
    Task<WeatherForecast> DeleteWeatherForecastAsync(int id);
}
```

### Example of a Repository Implementation:
```csharp
public class WeatherForecastRepository : IWeatherForecastRepository
{
     // The repository layer is responsible for CRUD operations.
     // The repository layer will call the database context to do the actual CRUD operations.
     // The repository layer will return the data to the service layer.
     private readonly WeatherForecastDbContext _context;
    
     public WeatherForecastRepository(WeatherForecastDbContext context)
     {
         _context = context;
     }
    
     public async Task<List<WeatherForecast>> GetWeatherForecastAsync()
     {
         return await _context.WeatherForecasts.ToListAsync();
     }
}
```

## Benefits of the Repository Pattern

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps your business logic separate from your data access logic.
- **Easier Testing**: You can mock the repository in unit tests to test your business logic without depending on the actual database.
- **Maintainability**: It’s easier to maintain and update the data access logic without affecting other parts of the application.

## What is Dependency Injection?

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a technique where objects (dependencies) are provided to a class instead of the class creating them itself. This allows for **loose coupling** and makes it easier to change the implementation or mock dependencies for testing.

### Key Points:
- Instead of a class creating its own dependencies, they are injected by an external source (like a DI container).
- In .NET Core, the DI container is built into the framework, and you can use it to manage dependencies at runtime.
- DI makes testing and maintaining your code easier because you can replace real dependencies with mock ones during testing.

### Example Without Dependency Injection:
```csharp
public class WeatherService
{
    private readonly WeatherForecastRepository _repository;

    public WeatherService()
    {
        _repository = new WeatherForecastRepository();  // The class creates its own dependencies
    }

    public void GetWeatherData()
    {
        var data = _repository.GetForecastsAsync();
    }
}
```

### Example With Dependency Injection:
```csharp
public class WeatherService
{
     private readonly IWeatherForecastRepository _weatherForecastRepo;
        
     public WeatherForecastService(IWeatherForecastRepository weatherForecastRepo) 
     {
         _weatherForecastRepo = weatherForecastRepo;
     }
    
     public async Task<WeatherForecast> CreateWeatherForecastAsync(WeatherForecast weatherForecast)
     {
         return await _weatherForecastRepo.CreateWeatherForecastAsync(weatherForecast);
     }
}
```

## How Does Dependency Injection Work in .NET Core?

In .NET Core, Dependency Injection is provided out of the box. You register your services (like repositories, database contexts, etc.) with the DI container, and the framework automatically provides these dependencies when needed.

### Steps to Use Dependency Injection:

1. **Register Dependencies**: Register your services (like repositories) with the DI container in the `Program.cs` file.
   
2. **Inject Dependencies**: Use **constructor injection** in your classes to receive the dependencies.

### Types of DI Scopes:
- **Transient**: A new instance is created every time the service is requested.
- **Scoped**: A single instance is created for each HTTP request.
- **Singleton**: A single instance is created and shared throughout the application lifetime.

## Example of Dependency Injection in a .NET Core Project

Here’s an example of how to register and use Dependency Injection in a Minimal API project:

### Registering Dependencies in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("RepositoryPatternTemplateDbConnection");

// Register the ApplicationDbContext with the DI container
builder.Services.AddDbContext<WeatherForecastDbContext>(options => options.UseNpgsql(connectionString));

// Register the repository with the DI container
builder.Services.AddScoped<IWeatherForecastService, WeatherForecastService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IWeatherForecastRepository, WeatherForecastRepository>();

var app = builder.Build();
```

### Injecting Dependencies in Minimal API:

```csharp
// Here we are calling the extension method MapWeatherEndpoints() to map the weather endpoints.    
app.MapWeatherEndpoints();
app.Run();
```

### Explanation:
- **`builder.Services.AddScoped<IWeatherForecastRepository, WeatherForecastRepository>();`**: This line registers the `WeatherForecastRepository` with the DI container. It tells .NET Core to inject an instance of `WeatherForecastRepository` whenever `IWeatherForecastRepository` is requested.
  
- In the `MapGet()` method, we request the `IWeatherForecastRepository`, and .NET Core automatically injects the correct repository instance.

## Conclusion

- **Repository Pattern** helps in separating the data access logic from the business logic.
- **Dependency Injection** makes it easy to manage dependencies and write testable, maintainable code.
- .NET Core provides built-in support for DI, making it simple to set up and use in your applications.
